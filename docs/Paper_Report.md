# Parallelism in Comparison Problems by Leslie G Valiant

The paper discusses the worst-case time complexity of algorithms for multiprocessor computers with binary comparisons as the basic operations. The example problems in this paper are that of finding the maximum, sorting, and merging a pair of sorted lists, with focus on showing that if the size of the input set is not less than the number of processors, speedups of at least $\mathcal{O}(k/\log \log k)$ can be achieved with respect to comparison operations. The algorithm for finding the maximum is proven to be optimal for all values of $k$ and $n$.

The paper introduces a model where $k$ processors are available, and each processor can perform a comparison operation simultaneously. The algorithms are synchronized so that each processor completes a comparison within each time interval. The next set of comparisons is determined based on the ordering relationships established so far. The computation terminates when enough relationships have been discovered to specify the solution to the problem.

The time complexity of each problem is expressed as a function of the number of processors and the size of the input set. The paper presents lower bounds and upper bounds for each problem. The lower bounds are derived using worst-case analysis, showing that a certain number of comparisons is necessary in the worst case. The upper bounds are achieved by designing algorithms that minimize the number of comparisons needed. The paper also discusses the tradeoff between increased speed (achieved by using more processors) and increased total number of comparisons.

For the problem of finding the maximum, the paper proves that a speedup factor of at least O(k/log log k) can be achieved for all values of k and n. For sorting and merging, the paper presents algorithms that require at most 2 log n log log n comparisons in the worst case. These algorithms improve on previously known algorithms and achieve faster sorting and merging on multiprocessor computers.

The paper concludes by suggesting that the model and analysis presented can be used as a theoretical background for studying parallelism in comparison problems. It acknowledges that practical considerations, such as inter-processor communication, need to be taken into account when designing algorithms for specific multiprocessor machines. The paper also highlights the problem of finding the median as a potentially interesting area for further research in parallelism.

Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the time complexity and speedup achievable for comparison problems on multiprocessor computers. It introduces a model and presents optimal algorithms for finding the maximum, sorting, and merging. The results contribute to the understanding of parallelism in comparison problems and offer insights into the design of efficient algorithms for multiprocessor systems.

# Finding the Maximum, Merging, and Sorting in a Parallel Computation Model by Yossi Shiloach

The paper describes various algorithms for parallel computation, specifically focusing on the problems of finding the maximum, merging, and sorting. The algorithms are designed for a model in which processors have access to a common memory and can perform operations such as reading, writing, and arithmetic.

The first algorithm discussed is Valiant's algorithm for finding the maximum of n elements. As discussed in the last section, it works by comparing pairs of elements using different processors and iteratively finding the maximum among them. The algorithm achieves a depth of O(log log n) and is optimal for certain values of p. It can handle the case where p is less than or equal to n, and also the case where p is greater than n. The algorithm takes into account the allocation of processors and the overhead involved in the comparisons.

Next, two algorithms for merging two sorted lists are presented. The first algorithm is for the case where p is less than or equal to n divided by the logarithm of n, and achieves a depth of O(log n). The second algorithm is for the case where p is greater than n divided by the logarithm of n, and achieves a depth of O(k), where k is a constant.

Finally, two algorithms for sorting n elements are discussed. The first algorithm is for the case where p is less than or equal to n, and achieves a depth of O(n/p + log n). The second algorithm is for the case where p is greater than n, and achieves a depth of O(k log n).

The paper also includes a discussion of the depth of each algorithm (for example, the depth of the merging algorithm when p is less than or equal to n is O(log n)) and compares them to other known algorithms. The authors conclude that their algorithms are optimal in terms of depth for the given problem.

# Optimal deterministic approximate parallel prefix sums and their applications
The paper discusses the computation of optimal deterministic approximate parallel prefix sums and their applications. The authors show that highly accurate approximations to the prefix sums of a sequence of integers can be computed deterministically in O(loglog n) time using O(n/loglogn) processors in the COMMON CRCW PRAM model. This complements previous randomized approximation methods and improves on previous deterministic results. The authors also present a lower bound for this problem obtained by Chaudhuri.

The ability to compute accurate approximate prefix sums has many applications. The authors demonstrate how it can be used to improve the time bounds for deterministic approximate selection and deterministic padded sorting. They also show how it can be used for problems such as approximate compaction and interval allocation.

The paper provides a step-by-step explanation of the algorithms used to compute accurate approximate prefix sums and their applications. It starts by discussing the computation of prefix sums and the optimal time complexity for different PRAM models. The authors then introduce the concept of consistent approximate prefix sums and how they can be computed deterministically. They also discuss the lower bounds for these problems and how their algorithms match these bounds.

The paper also discusses the implementation of the algorithms and the trade-offs between running time, number of processors, and accuracy of the approximations. The authors show that by using a linear number of processors, they can achieve optimal speedup while slightly sacrificing the accuracy of the approximations.

The authors conclude by discussing further applications of their algorithms, including their use in selection and sorting problems. They demonstrate how their algorithms can be used to find approximate solutions to these problems in near-optimal time complexity. They also mention the potential for future applications of their algorithms.

In summary, the paper presents algorithms for computing optimal deterministic approximate parallel prefix sums and their applications. The algorithms provide highly accurate approximations in near-optimal time complexity, and they can be used for problems such as selection, sorting, compaction, and interval allocation. The algorithms also provide trade-offs between running time, number of processors, and accuracy. Overall, the algorithms presented in the paper have significant implications for parallel computation.

# Parallel Merge Sort
The document discusses parallel merge sort algorithms and their implementations on different parallel random access machines (PRAMs). The main focus is on two algorithms: one for the CREW PRAM and another for the EREW PRAM. These algorithms aim to achieve efficient parallel sorting with a running time of O(log n) on n processors.

The first algorithm described is a parallel implementation of merge sort on a CREW PRAM. It uses n processors and achieves a running time of O(log n log log n). The algorithm is based on Valiant's merging procedure, which merges two sorted arrays in O(log log n) time using a linear number of processors. The algorithm divides the merge process into subproblems and uses Valiant's merging algorithm to solve each subproblem. The algorithm reduces the constant in the running time compared to previous algorithms.

The second algorithm described is a more complex version of the algorithm for the EREW PRAM. It also uses n processors and achieves a running time of O(log n). However, the constant in the running time is larger than the CREW algorithm. The algorithm performs the merge in two steps, similar to the CREW algorithm, but with additional considerations for the EREW PRAM architecture. It uses cross-ranks and rankings to efficiently perform the merge.

The document also mentions other sorting algorithms and their running times, such as Preparata's algorithm for the CREW PRAM and Bilardi and Nicolau's implementation of bitonic sort on the EREW PRAM. These algorithms provide alternative approaches to parallel sorting but may have different running times and resource requirements.

The algorithms discussed in the document have practical implications and can be used for various parallel computing tasks. They provide efficient parallel sorting algorithms that can be implemented on different PRAM architectures. The algorithms reduce the running time compared to previous algorithms and improve the efficiency of parallel sorting.

In addition to the sorting algorithms, the document briefly mentions a sublogarithmic time CRCW algorithm and a parametric search technique that can be used with the sorting algorithms. These techniques further enhance the capabilities of parallel sorting and allow for more complex computations.

Overall, the document provides a comprehensive overview of parallel merge sort algorithms and their implementations on different PRAM architectures. The algorithms offer efficient parallel sorting solutions with reduced running times and improved resource utilization. They contribute to the field of parallel computing and have practical applications in various domains.
